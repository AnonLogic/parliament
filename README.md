# parliament

Motion to replicate (with the intention of migration) the Fandom wiki to Github.

To maintain order in the Parliamentary body, a tight repository of logic called law is necessary. Our constitution provides the inception of this logic, but the Parliament has already evolved significantly since November 20, 2018. There are now two versions of the Constitution, more than 4 completed parliamentary sessions, at least 2 motions that have been ratified, a host of officers, and over a dozen parties. 

Currently, we are hosting everything on 4chan-parliament.fandom.com. As we have seen from today’s raids, this site is susceptible to raiding, because it lacks in extensible privileges.

Benefits of moving to Github:
- Complete audit log of all edits to the body of law.
- Robust method of versioning with hierarchical permissions that can be tailored according to our Constitution. I.e., the “master branch” may contain the official record of everything.
- Unraidable, unless Github itself is infiltrated, or our offices are compromised.
- Meta comments can be made by all on any document.
- Pull requests can be used for proposing edits to the constitution or any body.
- Metrics on most productive Assembly members.
- Portable via downloading the whole repo as a single zip file.
- Project tracking widget and wiki widget built into a repo - allows for the Executive to better ensure that execution of ratified motions occurs.

The two downsides of Github that I can anticipate are:
1) Anonymity. However, I am currently using it anonymously, as I have only provided GitHub with a proton mail email address and am behind 7 proxies, and have not linked it with my normal account, or any other identifying information. This level of opsec should be commonplace among our Assemblymen anyways, so this should not pose an obstacle.

2) Technical hurdle. Github can be complex to adopt for some. But the massive benefits of features and scalability outweighs this hurdle. Additionally, the hurdle can be reduced by walking all Assemblymen through a guide for using the GitHub interface in the browser, which will be sufficient for our purposes. As far as using it from the command line goes, it is more flexible, but it is not at all necessary for what we will be doing at first.

To give you a sense of what this could look like, I have mocked up a repository that reflects the current state of our Parliament, in this GitHub repository: 

https://github.com/philosopherkingsparty/parliament

At any time, even if this motion does not get ratified, any of you may download its entire contents, or “fork” it to your own repository (a new, anonymous account please!) and edit anything. In order to make this work in accordance with our constitution, we will simply need to change privileges over the repo such that the Kaiser owns the master branch, which will be the authoritative source of our Parliament’s laws.

Open source software packages used by millions are smoothly managed using Github alone. If we can successfully govern ourselves through Github, we stand a chance at our body politic growing to the same scale. This could very well become a political organization that supersedes the borders of 4chan.org.

I urge you to vote in favor of this motion.
